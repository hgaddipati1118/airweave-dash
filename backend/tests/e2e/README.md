# End-to-End (E2E) Tests for Airweave

This directory contains end-to-end tests for the Airweave platform. These tests verify that the entire system works correctly by testing the API endpoints with real HTTP requests against a running instance of the application.

## Overview

The E2E tests:

1. Start all required services using Docker Compose
2. Wait for services to be ready
3. Run tests against the live API
4. Tear down all services when tests complete

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+
- Poetry

## Running E2E Tests

To run all E2E tests:

```bash
cd backend
poetry run pytest tests/e2e -v
```

To run a specific E2E test:

```bash
cd backend
poetry run pytest tests/e2e/test_source_crud.py -v
```

## Architecture

The E2E test infrastructure consists of several key components:

### 1. Docker Configuration

- **Location**: `tests/docker/docker-compose.test.yml`
- **Purpose**: Defines all services needed for E2E testing
- **Services**:
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Weaviate vector store
  - Neo4j graph database
  - Backend API service

### 2. Docker Management

- **Component**: `DockerComposeManager` in `tests/helpers/docker.py`
- **Purpose**: Handles Docker Compose operations and service interactions
- **Features**:
  - Starting and stopping services
  - Health checks
  - Log access
  - Service URL and connection string generation
  - Command execution

### 3. E2E Test Runner

- **Component**: `E2ETestRunner` in `tests/e2e/runner.py`
- **Purpose**: Thin wrapper around DockerComposeManager for E2E-specific needs
- **Role**: Provides a consistent interface for E2E tests to interact with the Docker environment

### 4. Pytest Fixtures

- **Location**: `tests/e2e/conftest.py`
- **Key Fixtures**:
  - `e2e_environment`: Sets up and tears down the test environment
  - `e2e_api_url`: Provides the base URL for API requests

## Writing E2E Tests

When writing E2E tests:

1. Use the `e2e_environment` fixture to ensure services are running
2. Use the `e2e_api_url` fixture to get the base URL for API requests
3. Make HTTP requests to the API endpoints
4. Write assertions to verify the responses

Follow this pattern for test organization:

- **Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality verification (`tests/e2e/smoke/`)
- **Scenario Tests**: Complex user workflows (`tests/e2e/scenarios/`)
- **Feature-specific Tests**: Tests for specific features (direct in `tests/e2e/`)

## Minimal Mode

For faster test runs, the E2E environment can be started in "minimal mode":

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def e2e_environment() -> Generator[E2ETestRunner, None, None]:
    # Create runner with minimal mode (postgres and backend only)
    _runner = E2ETestRunner()
    # ...
```

This starts only the essential services (PostgreSQL and backend API), which is often sufficient for many API tests and reduces resource usage.

## Debugging

If tests fail, you can:

1. Check the logs using the runner:
   ```python
   def test_something(e2e_environment):
       # If a test fails, you can get logs
       logs = e2e_environment.get_container_logs("backend")
       print(logs)
   ```

2. Run the tests with more verbose output:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest tests/e2e -vv
   ```

3. Inspect the Docker container status manually during test development:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   docker logs <container_id>
   ```

## CI/CD Integration

These tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions. See the workflow configuration in `.github/workflows/test.yml` for details.

# E2E Testing with Hot Reloading

This directory contains end-to-end tests for the Airweave backend. The tests use Docker Compose to set up a test environment with all required services.

## Hot Reloading

The test environment now supports hot reloading for faster development cycles. When you make changes to the backend code, the server will automatically reload without requiring a full container rebuild.

### How it works

1. The backend container uses a development Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.dev`) that mounts the backend code as a volume
2. Uvicorn is started with the `--reload` flag to watch for file changes
3. The DockerComposeManager only rebuilds the container when explicitly requested

### Usage

#### Normal usage (with hot reloading)

```bash
# Run tests normally - hot reloading is enabled by default
pytest backend/tests/e2e/
```
### Benefits

- **Faster development cycles**: No need to wait for container rebuilds between code changes
- **Immediate feedback**: Changes to the backend code are reflected immediately
- **Selective rebuilding**: Only rebuild the container when necessary (e.g., after changing dependencies)

### Limitations

- Changes to the Dockerfile or dependencies still require a full rebuild
- The hot reloading only works for Python code, not for other files like static assets

# E2E Tests

This directory contains end-to-end tests for the Airweave backend.

## Overview

E2E tests verify the complete functionality of the system by testing API endpoints with a real database and all dependencies running.

## Structure

```
e2e/
├── conftest.py          # Shared fixtures and configuration
├── test_auth.py         # Authentication flow tests
├── test_connections.py  # Source/destination connection tests
├── test_sync.py         # Sync job tests
└── test_search.py       # Search functionality tests
```

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. Python environment with test dependencies

### Running All E2E Tests

```bash
# From backend directory
pytest tests/e2e -v
```

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/e2e/test_auth.py -v

# Run a specific test
pytest tests/e2e/test_auth.py::test_login -v
```

## Test Environment

- **Location**: `docker/docker-compose.test.yml`
- **Ports**: Uses different ports (9xxx) to avoid conflicts
- **Database**: Isolated PostgreSQL instance
- **Services**: All required services (Redis, Qdrant, etc.)

## Writing New Tests

1. Create a new test file in the `e2e` directory
2. Import the required fixtures from `conftest.py`
3. Write tests using the `async_client` fixture
4. Use realistic data and test complete workflows

Example:
```python
async def test_create_connection(async_client: AsyncClient, auth_headers: dict):
    response = await async_client.post(
        "/api/v1/connections",
        json={"name": "Test Connection", "type": "github"},
        headers=auth_headers
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201
```

## Best Practices

- Test complete user workflows, not just individual endpoints
- Use realistic test data
- Clean up test data after each test
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Keep tests independent and idempotent
