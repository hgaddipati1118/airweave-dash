# Connection Pool Sizing Strategy:
# - With proper connection management, workers only hold DB connections for milliseconds
# - Database operations: entity lookup (~0.1s), insert/update (~0.1s)
# - Even with 100 concurrent workers, only a few need connections at the same time
# - Pool size 15 + overflow 15 = 30 total connections available
# - This efficiently handles bursts while preventing connection exhaustion
# - Multiple sync jobs can run simultaneously without issues

# Determine pool size based on worker count
worker_count = getattr(settings, "SYNC_MAX_WORKERS", 100)
# With on-demand connections: pool_size = workers * 0.15 (only 15% need DB at once)
POOL_SIZE = min(15, max(10, int(worker_count * 0.15)))
MAX_OVERFLOW = POOL_SIZE  # Allow doubling during spikes

# Connection Pool Timeout Behavior:
# - pool_timeout=30: Wait up to 30 seconds for a connection to become available
# - If all connections are busy for 30+ seconds, raises TimeoutError
# - This prevents unbounded queueing and alerts to connection leaks
#
# Alternative configurations:
# - pool_timeout=0: Don't wait at all, fail immediately if no connections
# - pool_timeout=None: Wait forever (NOT RECOMMENDED - can cause deadlocks)
