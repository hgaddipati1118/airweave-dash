# Integrate with Slack on localhost

This guide will walk you through connecting your Slack workspace to Airweave when run locally. Slack does not allow OAuth2 flows for `http://localhost`, so this is a workaround.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a Slack workspace where you have permissions to add apps
- Administrator access to your Airweave instance

## Steps to Connect

### 1. Create a Slack App

1. Go to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click the "Create New App" button
3. Choose "From scratch"
4. Enter a name for your app (e.g., "Airweave")
5. Select the workspace you want to connect
6. Click "Create App"'

### 2. Configure OAuth Permissions

1. In your Slack app settings, navigate to "OAuth & Permissions" in the sidebar
2. Scroll down to the "Scopes" section
3. Under "User Token Scopes", add the following scopes:
   - `channels:history`
   - `channels:read`
   - `groups:read`
   - `im:read`
   - `mpim:read`
   - `users:read`

### 3. Install the App to Your Workspace

1. Scroll back to the top of the "OAuth & Permissions" page
2. Click the **Install to Workspace** button
3. Review the permissions and click "Allow"
4. After installation, you'll be redirected back to the app settings
5. Copy the "User OAuth Token" (it starts with `xoxp-`)

### 4. Add the Token to Airweave

1. In your Airweave application, navigate to the integrations section
2. Select "Slack" from the available integrations
3. Paste the Bot User OAuth Token you copied in the previous step
4. Complete any additional configuration required by Airweave
5. Save your changes

## Verification

After completing these steps, Airweave should be connected to your Slack workspace. You can verify this by checking the status of the integration in Airweave's dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission errors, ensure you've added all required scopes to your Slack app
- If the connection fails, verify that the token was copied correctly and hasn't expired
- For workspace connection issues, ensure you have the appropriate admin permissions in your Slack workspace
